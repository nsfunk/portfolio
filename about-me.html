      <h4>Artist & Front-End Developer</h4>
      <p>My name is Natalie Funk and I am new to the Seattle-area. I am orginally from metro-Detroit and a recent graduate at the University of Michigan. I got my Bachelor's of Fine Arts with a concentration in graphic design but took plently of classes in printmaking and illustration as well. My senior thesis was a comic book guide to adulthood called, #Adulting, when in reality it was about how we all have different journeys to feeling satisfied as an adult but that doesn't make us any less of an adult. I moved to Seattle last year to take on the challenge of living in a city and being away from my hometown. When choosing where to go Seattle seemed to be the most beautiful city surrounded by nature like I have never seen. I was truly inspired and took the next flight out. Now that I am here I want to dive deeper into what I want from my career. There are so many possibilities beyond the job of graphic designer that I want to explore.</p>
